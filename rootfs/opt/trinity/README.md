## 🔥 Description

This is the **first official TrinityOS build for Raspberry Pi**, a sacred, self-contained system that marks the beginning of the Trinity expansion beyond x86. It is lean, fast, and houses core components like:

- **GlyphGuard** (vault-based password system with gesture/biometric support)
- **StealthBridge** VPN layer (coming next)
- **Custom splash screen** (`splash.png`)
- **Self-checking prewrap integrity system**
- **Zero external dependency philosophy** — all tools, daemons, and logs live within TrinityAI.
